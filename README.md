### Nithish Chandrasekaran

I write code that ships. Full-stack by day, ML pipelines by night.  
Currently obsessed with the intersection of AI and real-world systems.

**What I've built**

[`ExoplanetAI`](https://github.com/NITHISH-2006/ExoplanetAI-V1) — Trained a classifier on stellar light curves to detect exoplanets using the same transit photometry technique NASA uses. Deployed on Streamlit. Co-authored an IEEE paper on the hybrid CNN + Random Forest approach behind it. → [Live](https://exoplanetai-v1-7myi4ebltsbtmw2ckekfa4.streamlit.app/) ·

[`AuthGate`](https://github.com/NITHISH-2006/AuthGate) — Authentication backend built around JWT, role-based access control, and ML-based anomaly detection for flagging suspicious logins.

[`Metro Route Optimizer`](https://github.com/NITHISH-2006/metro-schedule-smart) —  AI dashboard that automates train induction and scheduling for Kochi Metro. Predicts hourly passenger demand and auto-generates daily train schedules, cutting operator planning time from 2 hours to 15 minutes. → [Live](https://metro-schedule-smart.vercel.app) ·
